ChatLinker Browser Extension Privacy Policy

Last Updated: December 24, 2025

1. Overview

ChatLinker ("we," "our," or "us") is a browser extension designed to aggregate and manage multiple Large Language Model (LLM) services. It provides users with an immersive, desktop-like interface for efficient AI agent control. Unlike traditional bookmarks, ChatLinker offers a graphical interface and categorization system to help you organize your AI tools effectively.

We are committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data.

2. Data Collection

We Do NOT Collect Any Personal Information.

ChatLinker operates with a strict privacy-first philosophy. We do not collect, store, transmit, or sell any user data to external servers.

Specifically:

No Personal Information: We do not collect names, email addresses, or phone numbers.

No Browsing History: We do not track the websites you visit outside of the extension's specific functionality.

No Conversation Data: We do not have access to, nor do we store, the content of your conversations with AI services (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini). These interactions happen directly between your browser and the respective third-party service providers.

No Usage Tracking: We do not track your usage patterns or click behavior within the extension for analytics purposes.

3. Data Storage

All configuration data generated by ChatLinker is stored locally on your device.

Local Preferences: Settings such as icon arrangement, background wallpapers, category names, and custom URLs are saved using your browser's local storage capabilities (e.g., chrome.storage.local).

Data Control: Since data is stored locally, you have full control over it. Removing the extension will typically delete these local settings.

4. Permissions

To function correctly, ChatLinker requires the following minimum permissions:

Storage: This permission is strictly used to save your interface preferences (layout, categories, added sites) locally on your device so that your setup remains consistent across sessions.

Network Access / Host Permissions: This is required solely to allow the extension to load and display the third-party LLM services you choose to add within the extension's interface.

5. Third-Party Services

ChatLinker acts as a wrapper and aggregator. When you use an AI service within ChatLinker, you are interacting directly with that third-party platform.

Independent Policies: We are not responsible for the privacy practices, data collection, or content of these third-party services (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Anthropic).

User Responsibility: We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party AI service you access through ChatLinker.

6. Disclaimer

ChatLinker operates as a neutral tool for service aggregation. We do not own or operate the AI models accessible through the extension. Users must comply with the terms of service and usage policies of each respective LLM platform they access.

7. Policy Updates

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
Any changes to this policy will be communicated via extension updates or explicitly posted on our official website or repository.
